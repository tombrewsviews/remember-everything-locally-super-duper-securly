# Review After Changes

When you have completed making code changes and are satisfied with your implementation, you should proactively use the `/code-review` skill to review your work before presenting it to the user.

## When to Review

Run the code review skill in these situations:

1. **After implementing a feature** - Once you've completed writing code for a new feature
2. **After fixing bugs** - After you've made changes to fix reported issues
3. **After refactoring** - When you've restructured or improved existing code
4. **Before marking work complete** - As a final check before telling the user the work is done

## How to Use

Simply invoke the skill:
```
/code-review
```

The skill will automatically:
- Identify what changes you've made (unstaged, staged, or against main)
- Review those changes across quality, security, performance, and other dimensions
- Provide feedback on any issues found
- Offer to help fix any problems identified

## Benefits

Using this skill proactively helps you:
- Catch issues before the user sees them
- Ensure code quality and best practices
- Identify security vulnerabilities
- Verify your changes are complete and correct
- Demonstrate thoroughness and professionalism

## Important

Do NOT wait for the user to ask you to review your code. Make it a habit to review your own changes once you're satisfied with your implementation but before declaring the work complete.
