# Python Project Setup

- Use `pyenv` to manage python versions. Always use the latest version of Python.
- Use `uv` to manage dependencies. 
- ALWAYS use `uv` to write the initial `pyproject.toml`, then edit it with project specific details as needed.
- If you install any new dependencies, make sure to add documentation for them using the Tessl mcp. See [installing dependencies](./installing-dependencies.md).
- Use `pytest` for unit testing.
