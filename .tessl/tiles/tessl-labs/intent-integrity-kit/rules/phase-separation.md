# Phase Separation

- NEVER put technology choices (languages, frameworks, databases, libraries) in `CONSTITUTION.md` — those belong in `plan.md`
- NEVER put implementation details (schemas, APIs, file structures, architecture) in `spec.md` — those belong in `plan.md`
- NEVER put governance principles (project-wide rules, team process, non-negotiable standards) in `plan.md` — those belong in `CONSTITUTION.md`
- If you spot a violation, rewrite the content for the correct artifact rather than leaving it in the wrong place
