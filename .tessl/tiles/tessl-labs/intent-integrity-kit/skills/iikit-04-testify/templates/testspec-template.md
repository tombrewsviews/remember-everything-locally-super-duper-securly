# Gherkin Feature File Template

Generated by `/iikit-04-testify`. One `.feature` file per user story or logical grouping.
Place in: `FEATURE_DIR/tests/features/`

## Tag Conventions

- `@TS-XXX` — test specification ID (unique across all .feature files)
- `@FR-XXX` — functional requirement from spec.md
- `@US-XXX` — user story reference
- `@P1`-`@P3` — priority level
- `@acceptance` / `@contract` / `@validation` — test type

## Template

```gherkin
# DO NOT MODIFY SCENARIOS
# These .feature files define expected behavior derived from requirements.
# During implementation:
#   - Write step definitions to match these scenarios
#   - Fix code to pass tests, don't modify .feature files
#   - If requirements change, re-run /iikit-04-testify

@US-XXX
Feature: [Feature Name]
  [Brief description from user story]

  # Use Background when 3+ scenarios share the same Given steps

  # Acceptance test from spec.md
  @TS-001 @FR-XXX @P1 @acceptance
  Scenario: [Descriptive scenario name]
    Given [precondition]

  @TS-002 @FR-XXX @P1 @acceptance
  Scenario Outline: [Parameterized scenario name]
    Given [precondition with <param>]
    When [action with <input>]

  # Validation test from data-model.md
  @TS-020 @FR-XXX @P2 @validation
